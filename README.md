# Rubik's Cube Solver
This Python script is a Rubik's Cube solver using the IDA* (Iterative Deepening A*) algorithm. It includes functions for cube manipulation, movement application, and solving. The solver generates pruning tables for piece orientation and permutation, then searches for the solution with increasing depth.

## Instructions

1. **Download the Project Zip:**
   - Download the zip file named `Group2_Algo_Project.zip` from the provided link.

2. **Extract the Zip File:**
   - Extract the contents of the zip file to a directory of your choice.

3. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you extracted the files.

4. **Run the Python Script:**
   - Run the following command to execute the Rubik's Cube solver script:
     ```bash
     python Algo_project_rubic_cube_solver.py
     ```
   - Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.

5. **Follow the Output:**
   - The script will display the initial state of the Rubik's Cube, normalize face colors, generate pruning tables, and then start searching for a solution using iterative deepening A* search.

6. **Check the Solution:**
   - The script will print the sequence of moves needed to solve the Rubik's Cube if a solution is found.
  
   ### Or
   - You can directly run the file with .exe extension.
   
The script will display the initial cube state, normalize the stickers, generate pruning tables, and start the search for the optimal solution using IDA*.
## Example Usage
```bash
python Algo_project_rubic_cube_solver.py
